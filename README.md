# MaintenanceManager
MaintenanceManager is a Sponge plugin similar to [dakoslug's EmergencyDowntime Bukkit plugin](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/emergencydowntime/), essentially allowing admins to close their servers to players whilst performing maintenance.

Please visit [the Sponge forum post](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/wip-maintenancemanager/8740) for information on installation and usage, as well as download links.
