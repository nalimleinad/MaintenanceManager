MaintenanceManager is a Sponge plugin similar to [dakoslug's EmergencyDowntime Bukkit plugin][1], essentially allowing admins to close their servers to players whilst performing maintenance.

Please visit [the Sponge forum post][2] for information on installation and usage, as well as download links.
